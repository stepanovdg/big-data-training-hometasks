Shuffle
Input to the Reducer is the sorted output of the mappers. In this phase the framework fetches the relevant partition of the output of all the mappers, via HTTP.

Sort
The framework groups Reducer inputs by keys (since different mappers may have output the same key) in this stage.

The shuffle and sort phases occur ; while map-outputs are being fetched they are merged.

Secondary Sort
If equivalence rules for grouping the intermediate keys are required to be different from those for grouping keys before reduction, then one may specify a Comparator via . Since  can be used to control how intermediate keys are grouped, these can be used in conjunction to simulate secondary sort on values.

Reduce
In this phase the reduce method is called for each <key, (list of values)> pair in the grouped inputs.

The output of the reduce task is typically written to the FileSystem via .

Applications can use the Counter to report its statistics.

The output of the Reducer is not sorted.
